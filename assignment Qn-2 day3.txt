Assignment Question-2
1)var
Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
EX:
var tester = "hey hi";
    
    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
    console.log(hello);



2)let
let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var.
EX:let greeting = "say Hi";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
    }
   console.log(hello)

3)const
Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
EX:
const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";
